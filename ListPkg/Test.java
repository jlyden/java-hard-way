/*
 * TODO: Write a main function to test the new version of the nextElement 
 * 		 method in a (public) class named Test in the parent directory of 
 *		 the ListPkg subdirectory. The main function should include calls 
 * 		 that cause the new exception to be thrown, and should include code 
 * 		 to catch and handle the exception (e.g., first print a message saying 
 * 		 that a bad call is about to be made, then in the catch clause for 
 * 		 the exception print a message saying that the exception was thrown 
 * 		 and caught). The main function should also include calls to nextElement 
 * 		 that do not cause the exception to be thrown.
